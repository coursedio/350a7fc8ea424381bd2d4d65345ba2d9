00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.006
- Implementing AI can be complex,

2
00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:05.007
so don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it.

3
00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:07.004
If your business is just getting started

4
00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:10.003
with generative AI models or AI in general,

5
00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:12.006
working with industry experts, partners,

6
00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:16.004
or third-party vendors can be a great starting point.

7
00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:19.006
Many vendors can provide you with an established AI system,

8
00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:22.001
help you with data management and integration,

9
00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:23.005
and offer the technical support

10
00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:26.007
and expertise to help you get started faster.

11
00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:27.008
Just like in every process,

12
00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:29.004
when you try to select the best partner,

13
00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:32.001
look for reputation and experience and customer support,

14
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:33.006
and obviously, pricing.

15
00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:36.006
Make sure that they can satisfy the requirements we outlined

16
00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:38.002
in the previous section.

17
00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:40.007
Some of the largest tech companies in the world,

18
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:45.001
such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, InVideo, or Adobe,

19
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:47.008
offer a variety of generative AI tools

20
00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:50.004
for a wide range of applications.

21
00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:51.009
There are also other companies

22
00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:54.005
that offer specialized solutions.

23
00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:59.005
The most important thing, though, is knowing what you need.

24
00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:01.000
Now, some of you are considering

25
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.006
whether it's worth working directly

26
00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:05.006
with AI research organizations, like OpenAI.

27
00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:07.008
That really depends on your capabilities.

28
00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:10.007
If you have a highly specialized project,

29
00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:13.004
and you have the internal expertise and resources required

30
00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:16.000
to successfully implement AI on your own,

31
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.006
then that might be the preferred route for you.

32
00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:21.006
Be sure to take the time to assess several options.
