1
00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:02.004
- Now we understand how recent investments

2
00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:05.004
in AI might impact your business processes,

3
00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:08.001
let's go over several examples from a wide range

4
00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:10.009
of industries to give you a sense of what's possible.

5
00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.003
Whether or not your specific industry is mentioned,

6
00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:14.005
I'm sure you'll be able to draw

7
00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:16.005
similar patterns to your own work.

8
00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:17.007
Let's start with retail.

9
00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:19.006
We already talked about how AI could be used

10
00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:21.008
to personalize customer experiences.

11
00:00:21.008 --> 00:00:24.007
For example, an online clothing store could use AI

12
00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:26.009
to develop new closing styles based

13
00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.007
on the customer feedback or purchase history.

14
00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:31.006
It can create personalized product recommendations

15
00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:33.006
for each other or even simulate

16
00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:35.006
in-store real experiences

17
00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:38.000
in order to optimize store layouts.

18
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.002
In manufacturing, AI could be used

19
00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:42.005
to process design, product development,

20
00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:44.006
and even to optimize production.

21
00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:47.005
For example, a manufacturer could use generative AI

22
00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:49.003
to design a new car model

23
00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:52.005
or simulate multiple assembly line configurations,

24
00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:54.003
identifying the most efficient setup

25
00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:56.006
before implementing changes in the real world.

26
00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:58.009
In healthcare, AI could be used for tasks,

27
00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:01.002
such as medical imaging, diagnostics,

28
00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:02.006
and drug development.

29
00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:03.009
For example, it could be used

30
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:07.004
to provide diagnosis, create 3D medical images,

31
00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:10.006
or suggest new treatments or medications.

32
00:01:10.006 --> 00:01:13.001
In finance, AI could be used to enhance

33
00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:15.003
predictive analytics, algorithmic trading,

34
00:01:15.003 --> 00:01:16.006
and fraud detection.

35
00:01:16.006 --> 00:01:18.004
For example, a bank could use AI

36
00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:19.007
to do a better job at predicting

37
00:01:19.007 --> 00:01:22.008
risk in transactions, loan evaluations,

38
00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:25.006
or identifying potential fraud.

39
00:01:25.006 --> 00:01:27.004
In entertainment, AI could be used

40
00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:29.009
to create new sounds, music, or video.

41
00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.009
For example, a movie studio could use it

42
00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.006
to create new special effects

43
00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:35.008
or create realistic animations,

44
00:01:35.008 --> 00:01:38.005
and can even create an entirely new movie

45
00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:42.009
based on the script that was also generated by AI.

46
00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.005
In agriculture, AI could be used

47
00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:45.009
to optimize crop management

48
00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.001
and design new crop varieties

49
00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:50.000
with specific characteristics,

50
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.009
such as drought resistance

51
00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.005
by leveraging data on weather conditions,

52
00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:57.004
soil quality, and crop performance.

53
00:01:57.004 --> 00:01:59.008
In construction, AI could be used to design

54
00:01:59.008 --> 00:02:02.005
new buildings, optimize construction processes,

55
00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:04.003
or improve safety.

56
00:02:04.003 --> 00:02:06.007
By modeling construction methods,

57
00:02:06.007 --> 00:02:08.008
materials, and environmental factors,

58
00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:10.007
AI models could be used to simulate

59
00:02:10.007 --> 00:02:13.002
the construction process or even identify

60
00:02:13.002 --> 00:02:16.002
potential problems before it even occur.

61
00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:18.004
In traveling hospitality, AI could be used

62
00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:20.006
to optimize resource allocation,

63
00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:23.009
enhance the customer experience, or improve logistics.

64
00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:25.009
For example, a hotel chain could use AI

65
00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:28.000
to make personalized recommendations

66
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.005
and even write personalized notes for guests

67
00:02:30.005 --> 00:02:34.004
based on their preferences and past experiences.

68
00:02:34.004 --> 00:02:36.006
In advertising, AI could be used to generate

69
00:02:36.006 --> 00:02:39.006
completely new creatives to dramatically improve

70
00:02:39.006 --> 00:02:41.009
the accuracy of targeting.

71
00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:44.006
Imagine being able to create a highly personalized

72
00:02:44.006 --> 00:02:47.001
AI while averaging real-time data

73
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:51.008
to produce a one-of-a-kind experience for every user.

74
00:02:51.008 --> 00:02:54.003
In education, AI could be used to create

75
00:02:54.003 --> 00:02:57.003
adaptive content based on the learner's progress

76
00:02:57.003 --> 00:03:00.003
coupled with dedicated AI tutors.

77
00:03:00.003 --> 00:03:02.004
The dream of personalized education

78
00:03:02.004 --> 00:03:05.004
can truly come to life.

79
00:03:05.004 --> 00:03:07.000
And in scientific research,

80
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.005
one of the biggest challenges

81
00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:11.003
is keeping up with new studies and development.

82
00:03:11.003 --> 00:03:14.005
AI could be used to comprehend recent papers

83
00:03:14.005 --> 00:03:17.003
and keep scientists aware of any potential connections

84
00:03:17.003 --> 00:03:19.009
and breakthroughs that can elevate their work.

85
00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:23.003
It can dramatically accelerate scientific collaboration.

86
00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:25.003
Those are only a few examples

87
00:03:25.003 --> 00:03:27.003
of industries of product ideas,

88
00:03:27.003 --> 00:03:29.007
and as you can see, the potential applications

89
00:03:29.007 --> 00:03:32.009
of AI are far reaching and the examples here

90
00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:34.009
are just the tip of the iceberg.

91
00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:36.004
As the technology evolves

92
00:03:36.004 --> 00:03:38.004
and becomes more widely adopted,

93
00:03:38.004 --> 00:03:41.006
we will start seeing even more innovative applications.

94
00:03:41.006 --> 00:03:43.006
I encourage you to brainstorm ways AI

95
00:03:43.006 --> 00:03:45.008
could be applied to your specific industry

96
00:03:45.008 --> 00:03:47.004
and to your business.

97
00:03:47.004 --> 00:03:50.002
And as always, it's very powerful

98
00:03:50.002 --> 00:03:52.004
to think outside the box,

99
00:03:52.004 --> 00:03:54.001
especially when it comes

100
00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:56.000
to the potential applications of AI.
