00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.001
- You might be excited about the possibilities AI can offer

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:04.002
for your company.

3
00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:07.005
But the AI implementation is not the goal in itself.

4
00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:08.008
It's a means to an end,

5
00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:11.009
one that should help you meet your strategic objectives.

6
00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:13.005
As we discussed earlier,

7
00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:15.002
the first and most important step

8
00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:17.006
is clearly defining your business objective.

9
00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:19.005
Without a clear understanding

10
00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:21.008
of what you're trying to accomplish,

11
00:00:21.008 --> 00:00:24.001
you will never achieve your goal.

12
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:26.009
Think through the business problems you're trying to solve.

13
00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.009
Where are you looking to create the most impact

14
00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.009
for your company, and why is that the most important?

15
00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.001
Those could be process related.

16
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:36.003
For example, a manufacturing company

17
00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:40.002
might want to focus on optimizing its production processes

18
00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:43.001
or a consumer internet company might want to reimagine

19
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.009
its experience to increase customer loyalty.

20
00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:49.003
Start by sending out specific measurable outcomes

21
00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:50.007
for your objective.

22
00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:52.001
And if successful,

23
00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:54.001
what's the change you would like to see?

24
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:58.005
Next you need to evaluate your current capabilities.

25
00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:01.002
What are your strengths and gaps

26
00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:03.009
in relation to the objective you chose?

27
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:05.006
Understanding your current capabilities

28
00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:08.006
can help you determine where to start with AI

29
00:01:08.006 --> 00:01:10.000
and what types of projects

30
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.006
might have the highest ROI for you.

31
00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:13.009
If your company, for example,

32
00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.001
does not have experience with AI,

33
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:18.000
you might want to invest in training your employees

34
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.004
on machine learning and data science first

35
00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:23.004
so you can get the most out out of your AI projects.

36
00:01:23.004 --> 00:01:27.001
Don't just think of AI as a way to close gaps.

37
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:30.001
There's a good chance that AI can actually help you

38
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:31.003
boost the strength you already have.

39
00:01:31.003 --> 00:01:34.007
As a mental model, don't start by asking yourself

40
00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:36.006
where can I add AI?

41
00:01:36.006 --> 00:01:40.003
Ask yourself, given my objectives and my current state,

42
00:01:40.003 --> 00:01:42.003
and by thinking AI first,

43
00:01:42.003 --> 00:01:45.007
what can I do to create business value

44
00:01:45.007 --> 00:01:47.009
in a differentiated way?

45
00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.003
The third step is to identify the data needed

46
00:01:51.003 --> 00:01:53.001
to meet your objective.

47
00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:54.009
As we learned earlier, with AI,

48
00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.005
data is no longer a competitive advantage as it used to be.

49
00:01:57.005 --> 00:02:01.001
I would assume, for example, that many small businesses

50
00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:03.006
will have to rely on pre-train models like GPT

51
00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:05.000
and zero shot learning.

52
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.005
However, you still need to assess

53
00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:10.001
what kinds of data you will need

54
00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:11.008
and where you can get it from.

55
00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:13.004
It could be internal or external,

56
00:02:13.004 --> 00:02:16.001
and ideally the data is unique, it's high quality,

57
00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:18.005
and it's differentiated to you.

58
00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:21.003
I cover this in depth in my previous AI mindset course

59
00:02:21.003 --> 00:02:23.005
if you'd like to learn more about it.

60
00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:25.009
The fourth step is to select

61
00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:28.003
the right types of AI systems and tools.

62
00:02:28.003 --> 00:02:31.007
Choosing the right tools and platforms can go a long way

63
00:02:31.007 --> 00:02:34.002
in maximizing your success.

64
00:02:34.002 --> 00:02:36.003
So evaluating different AI systems

65
00:02:36.003 --> 00:02:37.007
against your specific goals

66
00:02:37.007 --> 00:02:39.005
will really help you select the right one

67
00:02:39.005 --> 00:02:41.007
that fits your needs the best.

68
00:02:41.007 --> 00:02:43.005
In the next couple of videos, we'll learn more

69
00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:45.004
about how to make those decisions.

70
00:02:45.004 --> 00:02:49.005
The final step is to monitor results,

71
00:02:49.005 --> 00:02:52.008
refine and assess progress and risks.

72
00:02:52.008 --> 00:02:56.000
This way you can make ongoing iterations and refinements

73
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
to your projects to achieve the best outcome for you.

74
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
It's also critical

75
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.008
that you consider the potential risks that can arise

76
00:03:03.008 --> 00:03:06.009
with your AI projects, such as privacy concerns

77
00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:10.002
bias in the data, copyright violation

78
00:03:10.002 --> 00:03:12.005
or even lack of transparency

79
00:03:12.005 --> 00:03:15.006
and take steps to address these issues upfront.

80
00:03:15.006 --> 00:03:19.000
In this course, we have a whole section dedicated to it

81
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
given how important this is.

82
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.006
So there you have it.

83
00:03:22.006 --> 00:03:24.003
If you're looking to get started,

84
00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:26.008
these five guidelines will help you make the most

85
00:03:26.008 --> 00:03:30.006
out of AI and unlock the potential for your business.

86
00:03:30.006 --> 00:03:34.001
So number one, clearly define your business objective.

87
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:37.006
Number two, evaluate your current capabilities.

88
00:03:37.006 --> 00:03:40.006
Number three, identify the data you need.

89
00:03:40.006 --> 00:03:44.007
Number four, select the right types of AI systems and tools,

90
00:03:44.007 --> 00:03:47.006
and lastly number five, monitor results,

91
00:03:47.006 --> 00:03:50.003
refine and assess progress and risks.
