00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.005
- Generally, AI models refer to artificial intelligence

2
00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:07.008
that can autonomously create or generate new content.

3
00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:11.006
In my previous course about developing an AI first mindset,

4
00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:14.000
we discussed how AI is used for analysis,

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.009
classification, optimization, and recommendation.

6
00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:21.000
Now, these new advanced AI models

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
can understand patterns, and relationships, and data

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.009
and then use that understanding to comprehend

9
00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:32.001
and then produce or synthesize new information.

10
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:35.004
This massive advancement in AI was made possible

11
00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:37.003
due to a number of factors,

12
00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:40.002
but arguably the three most important ones were

13
00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:43.005
the development of innovative deep learning architectures,

14
00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:46.000
such as transformers and diffusions,

15
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.009
which are facilitating more complex and efficient AI models.

16
00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:52.001
Number two is the rapid expansion and access

17
00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:55.009
to computing power, especially cloud computing,

18
00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:58.005
which has made compute more accessible and cost effective

19
00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:01.004
for AI researchers and companies like OpenAI

20
00:01:01.004 --> 00:01:04.006
who rely on it for developing and training their models.

21
00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:07.001
And number three is the ability to learn

22
00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:11.000
and train on an unprecedented data scale.

23
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.009
Essentially, the entire internet,

24
00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.009
take for example, an AI model

25
00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.009
that's trained on thousands of paintings

26
00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.008
from famous artists.

27
00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:21.009
The AI model will learn the style,

28
00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.004
the patterns, and techniques from these paintings

29
00:01:24.004 --> 00:01:26.004
and then utilize this knowledge

30
00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:30.004
to create new and sometimes unique works of art.

31
00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:31.007
Check out, for example,

32
00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:34.006
a photo I took of the sky of New York

33
00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:38.000
and how I recreated it in the style of a Renaissance painter

34
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.009
while adding some science fiction elements to it.

35
00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.004
That's pretty cool, right?

36
00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:45.009
Art is just one example.

37
00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.008
Let's talk about customer support.

38
00:01:48.008 --> 00:01:50.000
The latest AI models

39
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.003
are already trained on customer support best practices,

40
00:01:53.003 --> 00:01:56.007
from every product knowledge base available.

41
00:01:56.007 --> 00:02:00.005
Applying it within the setting of your own business

42
00:02:00.005 --> 00:02:04.002
can already enhance your customer experienced materially.

43
00:02:04.002 --> 00:02:07.003
And if you're using a conversational AI model,

44
00:02:07.003 --> 00:02:08.008
customers might not even realize

45
00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:12.000
that they're talking to a machine, unless you tell them.

46
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.002
Now, imagine you can fine tune it with your own data

47
00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:18.007
and include the uniqueness of each customer,

48
00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:22.001
your business model, your desired operating system,

49
00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:23.009
and your principles.

50
00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:25.005
You can then utilize this knowledge

51
00:02:25.005 --> 00:02:28.007
and establish a deeper connection with your customers

52
00:02:28.007 --> 00:02:32.002
and help provide the best service that matches your brand.

53
00:02:32.002 --> 00:02:34.006
Imagine building unique customer support models

54
00:02:34.006 --> 00:02:37.000
for healthcare, or travel, or government,

55
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.006
or utility companies.

56
00:02:38.006 --> 00:02:42.006
It's astonishing how extensible this technology can be.

57
00:02:42.006 --> 00:02:45.001
AI can be used to create new products or designs.

58
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:47.005
It could be used to reimagine user experiences,

59
00:02:47.005 --> 00:02:50.008
to reinvent workflows, and to improve decision making.

60
00:02:50.008 --> 00:02:53.006
The list is endless, and as a result,

61
00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:56.007
AI has the potential to significantly benefit

62
00:02:56.007 --> 00:03:01.009
and disrupt businesses across a wide range of sectors.

63
00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:04.008
Now, the disruption part might sound concerning

64
00:03:04.008 --> 00:03:06.003
but the more you know,

65
00:03:06.003 --> 00:03:08.000
the better position you'll be in

66
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.007
to leverage this technology positively

67
00:03:09.007 --> 00:03:12.003
for your business and for your customers.

68
00:03:12.003 --> 00:03:14.009
If you do have concerns or reservations,

69
00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:16.005
write them down

70
00:03:16.005 --> 00:03:18.001
and hopefully we'll be able to address them

71
00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:19.005
by the end of this course.

72
00:03:19.005 --> 00:03:20.006
In the next few sections

73
00:03:20.006 --> 00:03:22.001
I'll share several key components

74
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:25.006
that are typically involved in every AI project.

75
00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:28.000
I cover some of them in more depth in my previous course

76
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.007
in case you want to check it out.

77
00:03:29.007 --> 00:03:31.007
But for the purposes of this course,

78
00:03:31.007 --> 00:03:32.009
you only need to know

79
00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:34.008
the components mentioned in this section.

80
00:03:34.008 --> 00:03:35.009
So let's get started.
