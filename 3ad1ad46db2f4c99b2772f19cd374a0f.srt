00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.006
- It's incredible to see people's reactions to

2
00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:04.006
generative applications.

3
00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:07.002
At first, people get really excited.

4
00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:09.004
Wow, it could do this for me?

5
00:00:09.004 --> 00:00:12.006
That this is something that is usually very dear

6
00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:14.009
and near to their daily work.

7
00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.006
But sometimes that excited tone

8
00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:19.008
is replaced by a worrisome one

9
00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:21.006
when they realize the impact it can have

10
00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:24.005
on their daily work and responsibilities

11
00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:26.002
and that's not surprising.

12
00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:27.007
Today's AI can do anything,

13
00:00:27.007 --> 00:00:29.008
from seamlessly automating your workflows,

14
00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:32.002
to analyzing your financial situation,

15
00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:34.001
to offering personalized advice

16
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:36.004
on enhancing your business model.

17
00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:39.003
From writing speeches, to summarizing complex texts,

18
00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:41.001
to generating videos, movies,

19
00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:43.008
even creating new Broadway shows.

20
00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:46.006
For writing code, understanding code,

21
00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:48.005
reviewing somebody else's code,

22
00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:50.004
finding security breaches in your code,

23
00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:52.004
and even fixing them for you.

24
00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:54.009
I can go on and on and on.

25
00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:59.001
This list is endless and the potential is truly enormous.

26
00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:02.000
One of the most powerful ways to think of AI

27
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.009
is to think of it as your co-pilot,

28
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:06.000
your incredible collaborator

29
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.004
or that personal genie you always wanted.

30
00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:11.000
Imagine having an assistant,

31
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.001
extremely intelligent and capable, working alongside you

32
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:18.003
on everything you're trying to accomplish.

33
00:01:18.003 --> 00:01:20.009
That assistant has been exhaustively trained

34
00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.002
on all public knowledge available.

35
00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:25.002
Every book, every piece of literature,

36
00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:28.003
every artwork, and text that exists in the world.

37
00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:30.005
It has developed superior comprehension

38
00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:32.001
and generative skills.

39
00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:35.001
And its ability to learn, understand, and communicate,

40
00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:38.007
surpasses anything you have experienced before.

41
00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:43.005
It doesn't know you yet, but it would if you let it.

42
00:01:43.005 --> 00:01:45.007
Imagine a world

43
00:01:45.007 --> 00:01:48.007
in which AI can take your business idea

44
00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:51.002
and help make that a reality.

45
00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:54.002
What would you like to accomplish with it?

46
00:01:54.002 --> 00:01:57.007
Pause this video and take a few moments

47
00:01:57.007 --> 00:02:01.007
to think about one thing you or your business could use help

48
00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:05.009
with today and how this technology can help assist with it.

49
00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.009
And when you're ready, click play to continue.

50
00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.003
Now, if you're feeling unsure about how you

51
00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:14.009
or your business can benefit from this technology,

52
00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:16.005
don't worry about it.

53
00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:19.005
This can feel overwhelming, but by the end of this course,

54
00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:21.002
you'll have many ideas.

55
00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:23.001
If you're feeling somewhat uncomfortable,

56
00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:25.001
that's also expected.

57
00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:27.005
This technology can feel very personal,

58
00:02:27.005 --> 00:02:30.009
and when used incorrectly, it could lead to unintended even

59
00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:32.009
dangerous outcomes.

60
00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:35.007
If you already came up with many ideas, that's also

61
00:02:35.007 --> 00:02:37.000
not surprising.

62
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.001
The implications for you and your company are vast.

63
00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:43.000
Whether it's about transforming an internal process

64
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.004
or a product you have, every aspect of your work

65
00:02:46.004 --> 00:02:48.005
can potentially get enhanced.

66
00:02:48.005 --> 00:02:53.000
Keep in mind that failing to adopt AI in your business

67
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
can also potentially place you at a disadvantage.

68
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.007
As competitors will learn this new technology

69
00:02:59.007 --> 00:03:01.002
and it'll start creating exponentially

70
00:03:01.002 --> 00:03:03.000
better products than yours

71
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.006
with significantly higher productivity and lower costs.

72
00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:09.003
That's why in this course we'll learn how to keep

73
00:03:09.003 --> 00:03:12.001
up with this technology and reimagine your business

74
00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:14.005
or endeavor with generative AI models.
