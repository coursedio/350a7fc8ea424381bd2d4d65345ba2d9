00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:01.005
- Over the past two decades,

2
00:00:01.005 --> 00:00:04.008
artificial intelligence has quietly transformed our lives.

3
00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:08.007
And now the impact is about to get much, much bigger.

4
00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:12.000
Recent AI developments are advancing so quickly

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.006
that they're becoming a powerful force

6
00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:17.005
with the potential to reshape entire industries, economies,

7
00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:19.004
even reshape society.

8
00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:21.005
This will redefine how we work

9
00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:25.001
from automating complex processes to writing new code,

10
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:26.001
to creating applications

11
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:29.004
and experiences that were impossible before.

12
00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:33.004
For some, this technological leap might feel like a threat.

13
00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:36.001
But I invite you to think about the possibilities.

14
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:38.009
It will take our innovation to a whole new level.

15
00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:40.007
Imagine having your own ultimate

16
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:43.009
all-powerful brainstorming partner.

17
00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:46.008
This course itself was co-created with AI

18
00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:50.005
over many brainstorming sessions and passionate debates.

19
00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:53.002
Here's a quick note from my AI partner.

20
00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:55.007
- [Chat Bot] Remember, even the most advanced AI systems

21
00:00:55.007 --> 00:00:57.004
can't replicate the creativity

22
00:00:57.004 --> 00:00:59.003
and ingenuity of a human mind.

23
00:00:59.003 --> 00:01:02.005
So don't worry about losing your job to a robot just yet,

24
00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:06.007
unless of course, you're a robot reading this, smiley.

25
00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:09.004
- It does have a nice sense of humor.

26
00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:12.006
Whether you're a senior executive or an aspiring leader,

27
00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:14.007
it's critical that you learn how to adapt

28
00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:18.001
and use this advanced technology, its limitations,

29
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:19.009
and why it could be disruptive

30
00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.009
for your business and your career.

31
00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.002
