00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:02.008
- AI has the potential to impact

2
00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:05.000
a wide range of processes and products

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.005
across a variety of industries.

4
00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:10.000
Without a doubt, many of those implications

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.007
can be relevant for you and your company

6
00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:14.006
from productivity and efficiency,

7
00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:17.005
basically how can you do more with less using AI,

8
00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:19.005
to product innovation, how can you take

9
00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:22.000
your product experience to the next level.

10
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.006
When we think about productivity and efficiency,

11
00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:27.009
workflow automation is a good place to start.

12
00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.000
AI can help streamline tasks across the company.

13
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.005
These tasks do not have to be specific and basic.

14
00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:36.001
In fact, they can be pretty complex.

15
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:38.003
Let's take reports as an example.

16
00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:41.001
Using the right prompt in the workflow,

17
00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:43.005
AI can play a key role in creating,

18
00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:46.004
integrating, analyzing, and summarizing reports

19
00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.009
into insights and action items,

20
00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:51.002
not only saving time and resources,

21
00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:53.009
but also reducing errors and inconsistencies.

22
00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:56.007
Next, when coupled with automation,

23
00:00:56.007 --> 00:01:00.002
AI can start facilitating that end to end experience.

24
00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:02.005
In our customer service example,

25
00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:06.001
imagine being able to automate the entire workflow

26
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:09.006
starting from answering routine customer inquiries,

27
00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:12.003
then automatically logging tickets,

28
00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:15.004
finally working towards resolving the inquiries,

29
00:01:15.004 --> 00:01:18.006
and completely handling the back and forth for the customer.

30
00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:21.000
That's pretty remarkable, right?

31
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.001
When you're able to combine tasks and workflows

32
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:26.003
within a self-directed production,

33
00:01:26.003 --> 00:01:27.008
you can dramatically enhance

34
00:01:27.008 --> 00:01:30.005
your organizational productivity.

35
00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:33.009
This can be applied to many of your routine operations

36
00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.006
from finance to marketing to sales

37
00:01:36.006 --> 00:01:38.004
to product development.

38
00:01:38.004 --> 00:01:41.003
And to make things even more powerful,

39
00:01:41.003 --> 00:01:43.003
you can use AI to play a critical role

40
00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:46.005
in enhancing your own data and analytics capabilities

41
00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:49.007
by integrating data reports from multiple sources,

42
00:01:49.007 --> 00:01:52.004
creating a new, more comprehensive data set,

43
00:01:52.004 --> 00:01:53.009
generating synthetic data,

44
00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.002
which can mimic the properties of real data

45
00:01:56.002 --> 00:01:59.004
without exposing any sensitive information,

46
00:01:59.004 --> 00:02:01.008
and summarizing large data sets,

47
00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:05.008
making it easier to digest and understand the key findings.

48
00:02:05.008 --> 00:02:09.000
Essentially, you can train AI with your specific workflow

49
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.001
and decision-making process

50
00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:15.003
and incorporate it as the brain of your operation.

51
00:02:15.003 --> 00:02:18.009
These capabilities are not only for internal processes.

52
00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:21.007
If your product or service includes workflows,

53
00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:24.002
like many B2B software companies,

54
00:02:24.002 --> 00:02:25.008
you can then extend these capabilities

55
00:02:25.008 --> 00:02:28.007
into your product to drive innovation.

56
00:02:28.007 --> 00:02:29.009
You can start incorporating AI

57
00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:32.002
across several dimensions in your product,

58
00:02:32.002 --> 00:02:34.004
across all development cycle.

59
00:02:34.004 --> 00:02:36.006
AI can explore the design specs for your product

60
00:02:36.006 --> 00:02:38.008
and help identify potential gaps

61
00:02:38.008 --> 00:02:41.000
or suggest new combinations or features

62
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.006
or functionalities for you.

63
00:02:42.006 --> 00:02:44.007
Last, and potentially most important,

64
00:02:44.007 --> 00:02:46.000
it could speed up innovation

65
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.006
by taking on some of the creative heavy lifting.

66
00:02:48.006 --> 00:02:50.005
By modeling trends, patterns,

67
00:02:50.005 --> 00:02:52.004
and relationships in data,

68
00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:54.006
AI can generate new ideas and solutions

69
00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:56.005
that otherwise would not be apparent.

70
00:02:56.005 --> 00:02:58.007
This could be especially valuable

71
00:02:58.007 --> 00:03:01.002
when it comes to rapid product development.

72
00:03:01.002 --> 00:03:03.006
It could really help speed up time to market

73
00:03:03.006 --> 00:03:05.005
for innovative new ideas.

74
00:03:05.005 --> 00:03:07.005
With generative applications,

75
00:03:07.005 --> 00:03:10.005
no creative process has to start with a blank slate.

76
00:03:10.005 --> 00:03:11.008
You can jumpstart it easily

77
00:03:11.008 --> 00:03:13.008
with your AI brainstorming partner.

78
00:03:13.008 --> 00:03:15.005
Before you go to the next video,

79
00:03:15.005 --> 00:03:17.005
take a moment to brainstorm specific ways

80
00:03:17.005 --> 00:03:20.000
you can apply AI to your business.

81
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.007
Given the business objectives you outlined

82
00:03:21.007 --> 00:03:24.003
for yourself before, consider areas

83
00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:25.007
where you might be able to improve

84
00:03:25.007 --> 00:03:27.005
productivity or efficiency

85
00:03:27.005 --> 00:03:30.002
and how you can use AI to inspire product innovation.
