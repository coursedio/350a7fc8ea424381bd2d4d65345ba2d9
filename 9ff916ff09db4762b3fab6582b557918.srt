1
00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:03.000
- At this point, you might think, "Wow,

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.007
these generative AI models are insanely powerful

3
00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:09.006
and I want to get started with implementing them right away."

4
00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:11.009
Well, not quite.

5
00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:14.009
Today's AI models still have many critical pitfalls

6
00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.003
and limitations to keep in mind

7
00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:18.007
before you start working with them.

8
00:00:18.007 --> 00:00:21.000
Avoiding these mistakes can increase the chances

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.001
of success for your project.

10
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:25.008
I would expect that many of these pitfalls and limitations

11
00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:28.004
will get better over time, but in the meantime,

12
00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:31.005
it's important to be actively aware of them.

13
00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:35.005
Now, let's go over the 10 top pitfalls and limitations.

14
00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:40.000
Number one is an oversimplified view of your objective.

15
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.001
As we discussed, the most important thing for any project,

16
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:46.002
especially in AI projects,

17
00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:48.006
is setting the right objective and plan.

18
00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:51.007
Your AI output will be as good as you set it up to be,

19
00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:53.004
and an oversimplified view

20
00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:56.001
of what your objective should be can easily lead

21
00:00:56.001 --> 00:01:00.001
your algorithm and your company on the wrong path.

22
00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:03.004
Number two is high computational costs.

23
00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:05.005
Generating new content often requires

24
00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:08.007
significant computing space, power, and time.

25
00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:09.006
You might hear about it

26
00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:13.002
as GPUs or computing power constraints.

27
00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:15.009
GPU stands for graphic processing units,

28
00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:16.009
and they're often used

29
00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.003
for parallel processing in AI applications,

30
00:01:19.003 --> 00:01:22.002
which can really speed up computation time.

31
00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:24.006
However, if your AI system does not have

32
00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:27.004
enough sufficient GPU resources,

33
00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:29.004
this can limit the system's ability to handle

34
00:01:29.004 --> 00:01:33.001
large data sets or generate results quickly.

35
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:35.003
Furthermore, as we learned before,

36
00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:37.000
you might want to fine-tune the model

37
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.002
with a private instance of your own, and that increases cost

38
00:01:41.002 --> 00:01:44.006
and can become prohibitive unless the ROI is there for you.

39
00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:47.004
Number three is algorithm hallucination.

40
00:01:47.004 --> 00:01:52.004
Unlike humans, AI doesn't know how to say, "I don't know."

41
00:01:52.004 --> 00:01:56.003
In other words, it might make up things.

42
00:01:56.003 --> 00:01:58.009
This is a serious limitation of AI

43
00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.001
and can occur primarily when the algorithm trying to overfit

44
00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:05.004
on a small or biased data set, which results

45
00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:07.005
in generating outputs that are not representative

46
00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:09.000
of the real world.

47
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.003
It's key that you treat AI as a source of input,

48
00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:14.002
not a source of truth.

49
00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:18.003
In case AI is directly interacting with users or customers,

50
00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:20.005
ensure that you have the guardrails in place

51
00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:23.000
to avoid unintended consequences.

52
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.005
Number four is staleness.

53
00:02:25.005 --> 00:02:29.001
Generative models are susceptible to stale knowledge.

54
00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:31.005
In other words, the agent of systems developed

55
00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:34.004
can be limited by the data they have been trained on.

56
00:02:34.004 --> 00:02:37.005
This has implications for long-term effectiveness,

57
00:02:37.005 --> 00:02:39.004
as they might not be able to keep pace

58
00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:42.003
with fast-changing contexts or environments.

59
00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:44.007
Number five is restrictiveness.

60
00:02:44.007 --> 00:02:46.008
Generative AI models do not do well

61
00:02:46.008 --> 00:02:49.001
when it comes to access to basic information,

62
00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:53.006
such as telling the date or doing basic math calculations.

63
00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:55.007
Many algorithms are designed to work with text

64
00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:58.009
or image data, and that could limit the scope and capability

65
00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:00.006
of those systems.

66
00:03:00.006 --> 00:03:03.003
Number six is interpretability.

67
00:03:03.003 --> 00:03:06.008
Many AI models tend to be black box systems,

68
00:03:06.008 --> 00:03:09.006
meaning it can be difficult to understand why

69
00:03:09.006 --> 00:03:12.003
they generate a given output.

70
00:03:12.003 --> 00:03:14.003
This is problematic when trying to effectively

71
00:03:14.003 --> 00:03:18.001
diagnose errors or improve model performance.

72
00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:20.009
Number seven is token constraints.

73
00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:22.004
A token refers to a unit

74
00:03:22.004 --> 00:03:25.006
that the generative AI system is able to process

75
00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:27.003
at one time.

76
00:03:27.003 --> 00:03:29.004
It puts a limit on the amount

77
00:03:29.004 --> 00:03:32.002
of text that the system is able to accommodate,

78
00:03:32.002 --> 00:03:36.003
whether as input to the system or output out of the system.

79
00:03:36.003 --> 00:03:40.004
The amount of input is critical for success.

80
00:03:40.004 --> 00:03:42.002
The more you can bring nuanced

81
00:03:42.002 --> 00:03:45.001
and unique input into your prompt,

82
00:03:45.001 --> 00:03:48.001
the better and more accurate your solution could be.

83
00:03:48.001 --> 00:03:49.007
Token constraints can limit the types

84
00:03:49.007 --> 00:03:52.005
of data that can be used for training

85
00:03:52.005 --> 00:03:56.005
or the scope of problems that the system can address.

86
00:03:56.005 --> 00:03:59.009
Number eight is the ability to keep state.

87
00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:03.001
Keeping state or memory is essentially the ability

88
00:04:03.001 --> 00:04:06.000
to remember past inputs and build off them

89
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.002
in order to generate outputs.

90
00:04:08.002 --> 00:04:12.004
Think of it as working memory, short term or long term.

91
00:04:12.004 --> 00:04:16.003
For some AI applications, this ability is crucial.

92
00:04:16.003 --> 00:04:19.007
For example, a natural language generation algorithm

93
00:04:19.007 --> 00:04:22.009
might need to remember the context of the conversation

94
00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:24.001
so it could generate a response

95
00:04:24.001 --> 00:04:26.000
that may actually make sense.

96
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.001
Similarly, a generative art or music algorithm

97
00:04:29.001 --> 00:04:31.004
might need to remember previous brushstrokes

98
00:04:31.004 --> 00:04:34.008
or notes in order to create a cohesive work.

99
00:04:34.008 --> 00:04:36.000
Without this capability,

100
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.005
AI could struggle to generate accurate or coherent outputs.

101
00:04:40.005 --> 00:04:43.008
Number nine is data quality and availability.

102
00:04:43.008 --> 00:04:45.003
We already discussed the importance

103
00:04:45.003 --> 00:04:49.000
of feeding your AI with high-scale and high-quality data.

104
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.008
If your algorithm is learning from bad, low-scale,

105
00:04:51.008 --> 00:04:54.008
or biased data, the outputs it generates

106
00:04:54.008 --> 00:04:57.008
will be similarly biased or poor quality.

107
00:04:57.008 --> 00:05:01.002
Number 10 is about ethical concerns.

108
00:05:01.002 --> 00:05:03.005
AI can be used to create fake content

109
00:05:03.005 --> 00:05:05.005
or could be used for malicious purposes,

110
00:05:05.005 --> 00:05:09.009
such as creating disinformation or deep fake videos.

111
00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:12.009
It could also create copyright violations by copying content

112
00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.005
when it's not able to create something new.

113
00:05:15.005 --> 00:05:17.001
This especially happens when it's trained

114
00:05:17.001 --> 00:05:19.003
on a very small sample size.

115
00:05:19.003 --> 00:05:21.006
These issues and more raise a range

116
00:05:21.006 --> 00:05:24.009
of ethical concerns that need to be considered.

117
00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:28.000
Data quality and ethical concerns are so important

118
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.005
that I wanted to dedicate a separate video for them.

119
00:05:30.005 --> 00:05:32.001
So let's talk about that next.
