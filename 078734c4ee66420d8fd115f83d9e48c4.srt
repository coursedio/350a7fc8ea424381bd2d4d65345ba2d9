00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.000
- The most important aspect of every project,

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.001
especially AI projects, is the objective.

3
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:07.008
In the case of AI,

4
00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:10.003
this is about your algorithm's objective.

5
00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:13.009
What is your goal and what do you want to accomplish?

6
00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:14.007
It's important to know

7
00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:18.007
that AI ultimately learns to achieve a certain objective.

8
00:00:18.007 --> 00:00:19.009
Think for a moment.

9
00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.003
What's your objective?

10
00:00:22.003 --> 00:00:24.009
Your algorithms objective should ultimately ladder up

11
00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.008
to your business goal, and as we discussed before,

12
00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:31.009
when it comes to AI, the options are vast.

13
00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.003
This is why it's necessary to start

14
00:00:33.003 --> 00:00:36.000
with what you're trying to accomplish as a business,

15
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.006
and not with what is AI capable of doing?

16
00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:42.008
For example, in industries that rely heavily on creativity

17
00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:46.006
and novelty, you can use it to come up with new ideas.

18
00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:50.003
You can generate personalized textbooks in education.

19
00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:52.007
You can generate new levels in game design.

20
00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:56.002
You can even create new clothing styles in fashion,

21
00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:58.002
but in industries that rely heavily

22
00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:00.005
on processes and workflows,

23
00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:02.006
you can use it to automate tasks,

24
00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:04.009
streamline decision-making,

25
00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.006
and personalize a customer journey.

26
00:01:07.006 --> 00:01:08.004
This can range

27
00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:10.003
from B2B software companies that manage

28
00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:13.008
complex backend flows to medical companies looking

29
00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:16.002
to simplify their patient experience.

30
00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:18.002
As we'll discuss later in this course,

31
00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:21.004
AI can power those end-to-end workflows for you.

32
00:01:21.004 --> 00:01:25.008
At LinkedIn, we often look at AI as the matchmaker,

33
00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:29.006
helping connect job seekers with their dream companies,

34
00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:32.008
or brands with their buyers, or connecting communities

35
00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:35.003
of professionals looking to learn from each other.

36
00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:39.009
Now, regenerative AI models, you can take that even further,

37
00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.003
offering AI as a copilot for professionals

38
00:01:42.003 --> 00:01:44.006
to help them accomplish their explorations,

39
00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:47.009
all with the mission of connecting professionals

40
00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.003
to make them more productive and successful.

41
00:01:50.003 --> 00:01:52.001
In addition, a key part

42
00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:54.003
of our objective is to ensure

43
00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:56.007
we create a more equitable economic future

44
00:01:56.007 --> 00:01:58.008
for every professional.

45
00:01:58.008 --> 00:02:00.004
That's why equity is a big part

46
00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:03.004
of how we define our algorithm's objective.

47
00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:06.001
If you haven't made note of your business objective,

48
00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:07.008
make sure you pause this video

49
00:02:07.008 --> 00:02:10.005
and write it down before moving to the next one.

50
00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:14.001
And don't try to get it perfect, just write a few ideas.

51
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:16.000
Start with what challenges are most important

52
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.003
for your business to solve over the next few years.

53
00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:21.001
You can always revisit the objective later.

54
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:23.005
As we go through the course,

55
00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:24.006
think of how the lessons

56
00:02:24.006 --> 00:02:27.004
and takeaways connect back to your objective.
