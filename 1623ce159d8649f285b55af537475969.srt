00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.001
- An ethical and responsible AI approach

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:06.006
is critical to avoid unintended consequences.

3
00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:09.003
While AI is a powerful technology

4
00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:12.008
with the potential to bring transformative positive change,

5
00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:16.001
it could also carry inherent risks and concerns.

6
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:17.009
When it comes to developing AI applications,

7
00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.005
specifically generative AI ones,

8
00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:21.009
it's important to be mindful

9
00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.002
of the importance of ethics in data privacy.

10
00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:27.002
Here are a few guidelines to keep in mind

11
00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:29.001
for ethical AI development.

12
00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:30.008
Number one, transparency.

13
00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:34.007
As AI becomes prevalent, transparency becomes more critical.

14
00:00:34.007 --> 00:00:36.005
Companies should strive to be transparent

15
00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:38.003
with their use of AI,

16
00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:40.009
whether that by disclosing the types of data

17
00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:42.004
used in their algorithms

18
00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:45.007
or by explaining the decisions made by the system.

19
00:00:45.007 --> 00:00:47.003
Number two is bias.

20
00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:50.005
As we already learned, AI learns from data,

21
00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:54.001
and since data can be biased, so can AI.

22
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:55.003
Leaders should be careful

23
00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:57.005
to proactively ensure their AI systems

24
00:00:57.005 --> 00:01:00.006
are designed to avoid bias or discrimination

25
00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:02.005
in order to provide equitable outcomes

26
00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:05.003
for all customers they have.

27
00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:07.001
Number three is data privacy.

28
00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:09.009
Protecting sensitive customer and company data

29
00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.005
should always be a top priority.

30
00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:15.003
Companies should be thoughtful about how they collect,

31
00:01:15.003 --> 00:01:18.001
how they store, and how they use data.

32
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:20.003
Adhering to data privacy regulations

33
00:01:20.003 --> 00:01:21.008
and implementing best practices

34
00:01:21.008 --> 00:01:25.001
to ensure data remains secure and confidential.

35
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:27.007
When it comes to protecting customer data privacy,

36
00:01:27.007 --> 00:01:31.002
there are three specific actions you should take.

37
00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:33.004
Know what data you have.

38
00:01:33.004 --> 00:01:35.008
To protect customer data you need to understand

39
00:01:35.008 --> 00:01:38.009
what you are collecting and why.

40
00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.002
Know which data is sensitive

41
00:01:41.002 --> 00:01:44.009
and ensure it receives the highest level of protection.

42
00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.003
Establish clear policies.

43
00:01:47.003 --> 00:01:50.000
Your company should have a clear procedure

44
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.003
to safeguard customer data that complies with local laws.

45
00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:56.006
Educate your employees.

46
00:01:56.006 --> 00:02:00.000
Employees must understand the importance of data privacy

47
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.001
and the role they play in keeping customer data safe.

48
00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:06.007
Your company can provide training and resources

49
00:02:06.007 --> 00:02:10.007
to ensure employees know how to handle data responsibly.

50
00:02:10.007 --> 00:02:12.007
By taking these actions,

51
00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:15.009
companies not only comply with data privacy laws,

52
00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:17.009
but they also build trust with their customers

53
00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:20.009
by demonstrating their commitment to data privacy.

54
00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:22.005
Another potential risk with AI

55
00:02:22.005 --> 00:02:25.007
is intellectual property violations.

56
00:02:25.007 --> 00:02:29.002
If your company uses AI to generate content,

57
00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:30.008
it's necessary to ensure you're not

58
00:02:30.008 --> 00:02:32.002
unintentionally infringing

59
00:02:32.002 --> 00:02:34.009
on any copyrights or trademarks.

60
00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:38.007
To avoid IP violations, make sure your company is compliant

61
00:02:38.007 --> 00:02:40.008
with copyright to trademark laws,

62
00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:43.003
which could be unique to your local markets.

63
00:02:43.003 --> 00:02:45.005
Understanding these laws is the first step

64
00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:47.004
to avoiding violations.

65
00:02:47.004 --> 00:02:50.002
As you can see, the ethical challenges posed by AI

66
00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:53.001
are quite complex and multifaceted.

67
00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:55.005
One of the most material things a company can do

68
00:02:55.005 --> 00:02:59.003
to address these issues is to ensure that humans

69
00:02:59.003 --> 00:03:01.006
are actively overseeing the development

70
00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:03.004
and application of AI.

71
00:03:03.004 --> 00:03:06.008
Some key steps in this direction include, number one,

72
00:03:06.008 --> 00:03:09.003
establishing reporting and feedback mechanisms

73
00:03:09.003 --> 00:03:12.009
that allow customers and employees to flag problems.

74
00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:16.003
Number two, thoroughly reviewing any prompts and outputs

75
00:03:16.003 --> 00:03:17.007
that are generated programmatically

76
00:03:17.007 --> 00:03:20.007
in order to catch potential issues early on.

77
00:03:20.007 --> 00:03:24.002
And number three, educating users of AI content

78
00:03:24.002 --> 00:03:26.003
about the responsibilities

79
00:03:26.003 --> 00:03:29.005
when incorporating it into their own work.

80
00:03:29.005 --> 00:03:32.002
These are just a few steps,

81
00:03:32.002 --> 00:03:34.001
but for fuller understanding of the role

82
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:35.005
and responsibility of AI,
