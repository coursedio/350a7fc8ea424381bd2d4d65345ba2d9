00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:03.001
- At this point, you should have a basic understanding

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:06.008
of how AI might become more integrated into your business.

3
00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:08.002
But now let's talk about

4
00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:10.009
how you bring your team along for the ride.

5
00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:12.004
As a business leader,

6
00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:14.001
you are in a unique position

7
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:18.001
to help drive positive change within your organization.

8
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:20.007
Think about how you can encourage your team

9
00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:23.005
to embrace and lead with AI.

10
00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:26.003
I'm a big believer that you can't manage

11
00:00:26.003 --> 00:00:28.009
what you don't understand.

12
00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.002
By demystifying this technology,

13
00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:33.005
you can address any fears or hesitations

14
00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:34.008
your team might have

15
00:00:34.008 --> 00:00:38.007
and empower them to become ambassadors for innovation.

16
00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:40.001
In the next section,

17
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:42.009
we'll learn about the limitations of AI today

18
00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:44.001
and why it's important to keep

19
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:46.008
responsible AI principles in mind.

20
00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:49.000
That will help you and your team

21
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.004
develop a more rounded perspective

22
00:00:51.004 --> 00:00:55.000
of what's possible today and what they can expect next.

23
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.004
Remember, you and your team

24
00:00:57.004 --> 00:01:00.002
don't have to be technology experts

25
00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:03.001
but deepening your collective understanding of AI

26
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:07.000
will help you make more informed decisions moving forward.

27
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.008
Before we finish this section,

28
00:01:08.008 --> 00:01:11.001
I have one more recommendation for you.

29
00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:13.007
Given the novel nature of this technology

30
00:01:13.007 --> 00:01:16.009
it can be extremely beneficial to empower your organization

31
00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.007
to actively participate and experiment with new ideas.

32
00:01:20.007 --> 00:01:22.000
For that purpose

33
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.001
I would propose you create

34
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:26.005
a lightweight playground or sandbox environment

35
00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:28.008
to help your teams experiment with ideas

36
00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:30.009
in a low cost, safe way

37
00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.006
before they go and build a full plan for them.

38
00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:35.007
The next big idea for your business

39
00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:38.005
can come from anyone in your company.

40
00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:40.002
So if you can foster a culture

41
00:01:40.002 --> 00:01:42.006
of experimentation and innovation

42
00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:45.009
while keeping responsible AI principles in mind,

43
00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.009
you'll be well positioned to reap the benefits

44
00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.005
of AI as it evolves.
