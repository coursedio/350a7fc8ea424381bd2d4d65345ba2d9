00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.002
- Now that you have an idea of your company's needs,

2
00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:05.004
let's go deeper into how to select

3
00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:08.000
the right type of AI for your business.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.009
There are many different types of AI systems and tools,

5
00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:14.005
and choosing the right one is crucial for success.

6
00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:17.003
For additional context, check out the course notes

7
00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:20.006
for the core and generative AI landscape map.

8
00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:23.001
But let's start with data requirements.

9
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:25.007
When you evaluate types of AI systems,

10
00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:27.006
consider the following.

11
00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:31.009
What formats of data do you need for your project?

12
00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.002
What would be your input data?

13
00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:36.009
What would be your desired output data?

14
00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:39.000
Different types of AI models and applications

15
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.007
accept and generate different formats of data,

16
00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:44.001
such as text or images.

17
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:47.005
How often will your data need to be refreshed?

18
00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:49.005
Depending on your business objective,

19
00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:53.004
data might need to be refreshed daily or weekly or monthly.

20
00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:56.005
And for some applications such as medical diagnostics,

21
00:00:56.005 --> 00:01:01.001
a continuous stream of realtime data might even be needed.

22
00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:05.003
Next, what source of high-quality data do you have at scale?

23
00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:08.004
It could be owned by you or coming through partnerships.

24
00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:11.007
Remember that the focus should be on proprietary data.

25
00:01:11.007 --> 00:01:14.000
For example, if your company is looking to use AI

26
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.004
for pharmaceutical research or drug discovery,

27
00:01:17.004 --> 00:01:19.002
then data on molecular structures

28
00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:22.005
and biological pathways might be needed.

29
00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:25.007
So data will need to be refreshed frequently

30
00:01:25.007 --> 00:01:27.008
as new findings emerge.

31
00:01:27.008 --> 00:01:30.003
And the AI system you choose should be able

32
00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:33.009
to handle the scale, the complex interactions,

33
00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.003
and analyze vast quantities of data.

34
00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:39.000
Or if your company's planning to use AI

35
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.002
to improve the accuracy of demand forecasting,

36
00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:44.002
then data on past sales performance,

37
00:01:44.002 --> 00:01:46.007
economic indicators, reports on industry trends

38
00:01:46.007 --> 00:01:50.002
and customer behavior might be needed.

39
00:01:50.002 --> 00:01:53.001
The system will need to assimilate large data sets

40
00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:57.002
in different formats and continuously update

41
00:01:57.002 --> 00:01:59.003
as new data becomes available

42
00:01:59.003 --> 00:02:01.002
and then generate accurate predictions

43
00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:03.004
for different products and markets.

44
00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:06.003
So now let's transition to the type of AI you need.

45
00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:09.009
This is basically the AI engine you want to implement.

46
00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.002
If your goal is to use AI to create product designs,

47
00:02:13.002 --> 00:02:16.000
you might want to use a system that has specific capabilities

48
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.004
for 3D modeling or animations,

49
00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:19.008
or if you're interested in using AI

50
00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:21.006
to improve customer service,

51
00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:23.001
you might want a system that excels

52
00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:26.004
in natural language processing or chat bot development.

53
00:02:26.004 --> 00:02:30.005
Or, you might want a system design or product schema

54
00:02:30.005 --> 00:02:35.001
that is a mix of workflows and generation and automation.

55
00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:38.001
Once you have an idea of the type of system you need,

56
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:40.008
there are three more considerations for you.

57
00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:43.001
The first one is implementation.

58
00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:45.004
How easy or difficult will it be

59
00:02:45.004 --> 00:02:48.003
to implement this type of AI in your company?

60
00:02:48.003 --> 00:02:51.005
Consider the technical resources, the personnel, the cost,

61
00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:53.004
and the time needed to integrate the model

62
00:02:53.004 --> 00:02:55.007
into your business processes.

63
00:02:55.007 --> 00:03:00.008
Second, scalability, can the model scale with your business?

64
00:03:00.008 --> 00:03:02.004
You want to choose a type of AI

65
00:03:02.004 --> 00:03:05.001
that will be able to grow with your company

66
00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:06.006
rather than becoming obsolete

67
00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:09.006
or struggling to handle the increased volume.

68
00:03:09.006 --> 00:03:12.000
And lastly, transparency.

69
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.001
Are you able to understand

70
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:15.009
how the model is making its decisions?

71
00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:19.003
Transparency is crucial for establishing trust,

72
00:03:19.003 --> 00:03:22.004
and can help you fine tune the model over time.

73
00:03:22.004 --> 00:03:24.005
With this information fresh in your mind,

74
00:03:24.005 --> 00:03:26.005
I want you to pause this video

75
00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:30.000
and write down your specific requirements

76
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
to ensure you're selecting the best solution for your needs.
