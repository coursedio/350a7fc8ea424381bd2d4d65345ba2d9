00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.001
- The impact of AI on society

2
00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.005
will be undoubtedly very large.

3
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:06.008
while society is still getting warmed up to the idea

4
00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:10.003
of self-driving cars, imagine getting used to the idea

5
00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:14.002
of AI-powered doctors or AI-powered psychologists.

6
00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:17.007
It would also become very personal and intimate.

7
00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:20.007
Imagining a dedicated AI model that runs across your phone,

8
00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:23.001
your computer, your photo albums, your voicemail

9
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:25.005
and every piece of digital footprint you have.

10
00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:28.007
Imagining its ability to understand how you think,

11
00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:31.006
how you talk, and how you act.

12
00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:35.008
Now, couple that with deep fake technologies

13
00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:37.008
that can mimic your voice and image

14
00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:40.001
with extraordinary precision.

15
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:43.004
As you can imagine, this concept goes well

16
00:00:43.004 --> 00:00:47.000
beyond the metaverse of extending our identities online

17
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.006
to being able to mimic our identities,

18
00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:52.007
at least based on what's possible today digitally.

19
00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:55.004
This brings with it enormous societal challenges

20
00:00:55.004 --> 00:00:58.000
that will continue for the foreseeable future.

21
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.009
This is probably the right time to mention

22
00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:02.006
that as AI continues to evolve, we can also expect

23
00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:04.006
regulators and governments to increase focus

24
00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:07.005
on responsible AI development with new policies

25
00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:11.004
and laws overseeing the use and applications of AI.

26
00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:13.001
Throughout this course,

27
00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:16.001
we discussed AI's extraordinary ability to extract

28
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:19.008
and generate insights and information from large data sets.

29
00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:22.005
Basically, it can comprehend and then regenerate

30
00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:24.003
all existing knowledge,

31
00:01:24.003 --> 00:01:27.005
but what about creating completely new knowledge?

32
00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:29.009
Can AI come up with new scientific ideas

33
00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.008
or scientific hypotheses?

34
00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:34.007
Imagine AI coming up with new answers or solutions

35
00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:38.001
for some of the biggest scientific mysteries we have today,

36
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:41.009
such as what is dark matter and dark energy?

37
00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.000
How does the brain create consciousness?

38
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.002
What is one's self?

39
00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:49.009
What is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics?

40
00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.001
What causes Alzheimer's disease?

41
00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:56.009
AI cannot answer these questions yet.

42
00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.001
Currently, it only operates within existing knowledge,

43
00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:04.002
but that can change, and AI can become better

44
00:02:04.002 --> 00:02:07.007
at extracting and generating insights and informations,

45
00:02:07.007 --> 00:02:11.002
enabling it to come up with new hypotheses or theories.

46
00:02:11.002 --> 00:02:14.001
At that point, we're looking at a whole new frontier

47
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:15.002
for the human race.
