1
00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.004
- Futurists often talk

2
00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:05.001
about how the difference between science fiction

3
00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:08.001
and non-fiction is just a matter of time.

4
00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:09.005
I agree.

5
00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:12.009
In my previous course about developing an AI-first mindset,

6
00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.005
I discussed the incredible potential

7
00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:16.008
of artificial general intelligence

8
00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:19.002
and how that future is very near.

9
00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:22.008
The velocity of AI has exceeded my expectation since then.

10
00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:26.002
We are living in an era of unprecedented innovation,

11
00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:28.002
and that's not about to slow down.

12
00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:30.000
I believe it will accelerate.

13
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.004
As we discussed in this course, it's clear

14
00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:34.004
that AI will continue to play an increasingly

15
00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:37.002
important role in every industry.

16
00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:40.003
As the technology becomes more accessible, accurate,

17
00:00:40.003 --> 00:00:42.001
and cost effective,

18
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.009
we can expect this trend to continue with more

19
00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:47.003
and more companies adopting advanced AI applications

20
00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:49.004
in their day-to-day operations.

21
00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:52.008
It will no doubt have a lasting impact on society.

22
00:00:52.008 --> 00:00:55.008
Instead of trying to predict the exact future,

23
00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:56.007
I'd like to share with you

24
00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:59.009
a mental framing of what changes we should expect.

25
00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:02.006
Here are a few dimensions to consider.

26
00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:06.007
Number one, investment in algorithms.

27
00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:10.001
Generative algorithms are continuously evolving,

28
00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:11.003
and there are still limitations

29
00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:14.007
in terms of accuracy, speed, and generalization.

30
00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:16.006
I expect these algorithms to evolve

31
00:01:16.006 --> 00:01:19.006
and become more and more sophisticated over time.

32
00:01:19.006 --> 00:01:24.000
Number two, reduce demand for computing power.

33
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.001
Without GPU constraints,

34
00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:29.000
AI systems can handle larger data sets,

35
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
perform computations faster,

36
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.009
and deliver results in near real time.

37
00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.007
And number three, allowance of more tokens.

38
00:01:37.007 --> 00:01:40.005
Without token constraints, AI could be used to

39
00:01:40.005 --> 00:01:43.003
address the wider variety of tasks

40
00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:45.009
as they'll be able to better equipped to handle longer

41
00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.000
and more complex inputs.

42
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.006
And lastly, computational resources.

43
00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:53.006
GPU and token constraints are some

44
00:01:53.006 --> 00:01:55.008
of the most common bottlenecks.

45
00:01:55.008 --> 00:01:57.005
But AI systems can also be limited

46
00:01:57.005 --> 00:01:59.007
by other computational resources,

47
00:01:59.007 --> 00:02:03.005
such as CPU power, memory, or storage.

48
00:02:03.005 --> 00:02:06.001
As these constraints are lifted over time,

49
00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:08.007
performance will continue to improve.

50
00:02:08.007 --> 00:02:11.004
This would mean more accurate predictions,

51
00:02:11.004 --> 00:02:14.006
greater efficiency, increased capabilities,

52
00:02:14.006 --> 00:02:18.007
faster iteration times, and more creative outputs.

53
00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:22.004
Imagine a continuously evolving better brain.

54
00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:25.000
These advancements will compound over time,

55
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.002
as each cycle will pave the way for the next one.

56
00:02:28.002 --> 00:02:30.007
While generative AI models will be used primarily

57
00:02:30.007 --> 00:02:34.002
in a few use cases, at first, they will likely expand,

58
00:02:34.002 --> 00:02:36.009
increase prevalence, and become broadly used

59
00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:40.002
over the next few years, transforming industries

60
00:02:40.002 --> 00:02:42.005
and creating new opportunities for businesses.
