00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.007
- In AI, data matters a lot.

2
00:00:03.007 --> 00:00:05.004
If you've been tracking AI for a while,

3
00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:08.007
or took my previous course, you know the reason for it.

4
00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:12.002
AI learns and trains itself with examples,

5
00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:15.003
past examples and real-time examples,

6
00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:17.003
and those data samples are the fuel

7
00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:19.008
that helps AI achieve its objective.

8
00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:22.000
The fuel analogy was real.

9
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.008
Several years ago, data was even coined as the new oil.

10
00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:27.006
The more quality data you had,

11
00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:29.004
the better the results you got,

12
00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:32.001
the bigger the competitive mode you developed,

13
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:35.007
and the more successful you ultimately became as a company.

14
00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:37.004
The latest AI models are challenging

15
00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:39.005
that competitive advantage.

16
00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:41.002
One of the most impressive aspects

17
00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:43.003
of recent generative AI models

18
00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:44.007
is that they're already trained

19
00:00:44.007 --> 00:00:46.006
on the world's public knowledge.

20
00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:50.002
And now that's accessible to everyone,

21
00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:52.005
which will make it a commodity over time.

22
00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:54.008
Recent developments also enable AI models

23
00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:57.001
to create synthetic mock data,

24
00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:59.005
or even learn without any data,

25
00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:02.003
which is useful in cold start situations,

26
00:01:02.003 --> 00:01:04.004
where it's difficult or impossible

27
00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:07.000
to obtain examples of training data.

28
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
These developments lower the barriers to entry

29
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.007
for companies that otherwise would not be able to compete.

30
00:01:12.007 --> 00:01:14.006
So if you are in this no data camp,

31
00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:16.004
that's great news for you.

32
00:01:16.004 --> 00:01:18.000
But what does it mean for businesses

33
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.003
that heavily rely on proprietary data

34
00:01:20.003 --> 00:01:24.001
that is either owned or controlled exclusively by them?

35
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:27.004
Well, if that's you, it's time to rethink your strengths

36
00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:29.008
as a business and extend your abilities

37
00:01:29.008 --> 00:01:32.003
beyond data capabilities.

38
00:01:32.003 --> 00:01:35.004
Data alone will not be sufficient.

39
00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:39.003
That said, proprietary data still matters,

40
00:01:39.003 --> 00:01:41.007
especially if you can fine-tune the model

41
00:01:41.007 --> 00:01:44.003
towards a specific task.

42
00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:46.009
Now, you might be asking, "What is fine-tuning,"

43
00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.007
"and why is it important?"

44
00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:51.003
AI models like GPT, which stands for

45
00:01:51.003 --> 00:01:53.005
generative pretrained transformer,

46
00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:56.000
are general purpose AI models,

47
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.004
which have a broader objective function

48
00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:01.005
and are already trained on all public knowledge.

49
00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:03.006
They know as much as possible,

50
00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:07.009
and are designed to perform reasonably well in many tasks,

51
00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.006
just like generalists.

52
00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:14.001
ChatGPT, which is the conversational application of GPT,

53
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:16.005
is one example of these models,

54
00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:18.007
but you can fine-tune these models

55
00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:22.001
to be specialists in a specific area

56
00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:25.007
by training them on unique examples you have.

57
00:02:25.007 --> 00:02:28.002
And during this fine-tuning process,

58
00:02:28.002 --> 00:02:32.008
the model will adjust its parameters to better fit your data

59
00:02:32.008 --> 00:02:34.008
while still learning the knowledge

60
00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:37.005
it has gained in the past.

61
00:02:37.005 --> 00:02:40.007
This allows the model to become a specialist

62
00:02:40.007 --> 00:02:43.008
in a specific area that you want it to learn,

63
00:02:43.008 --> 00:02:47.002
while still being able to generate in a general way.

64
00:02:47.002 --> 00:02:49.008
Imagine taking athletes and training them

65
00:02:49.008 --> 00:02:53.006
to be distance runners, or weightlifters, or gymnasts.

66
00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:56.004
You can, and probably should do the same

67
00:02:56.004 --> 00:02:58.001
with your application.

68
00:02:58.001 --> 00:03:00.008
Otherwise, your product will not be very different

69
00:03:00.008 --> 00:03:02.004
than anybody else's.

70
00:03:02.004 --> 00:03:04.000
You'll be relying on the same capability

71
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.009
everybody else is using.

72
00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:08.007
Now, you might be thinking that fine-tuning is your answer

73
00:03:08.007 --> 00:03:11.003
to maintaining some of your competitive advantage,

74
00:03:11.003 --> 00:03:13.009
but it's important to know that creating a private instance

75
00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:17.004
of your own fine-tune model can be very expensive

76
00:03:17.004 --> 00:03:19.002
and difficult to maintain.

77
00:03:19.002 --> 00:03:20.009
We'll talk more about that later

78
00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:23.002
in the AI limitation sections of this course.
